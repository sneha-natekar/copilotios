## Project Description

This project is a simple "Hello World" iOS app. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how to set up a development environment for iOS app development using GitHub Codespaces.

## Setting Up the Development Environment

To set up the development environment for this project using GitHub Codespaces, follow these steps:

1. Open the repository in GitHub.
2. Click on the "Code" button and select "Open with Codespaces".
3. If you don't have a Codespace already, create a new one.
4. Once the Codespace is created, it will automatically use the configuration specified in the `.devcontainer` directory to set up the development environment.
5. You can start coding and building the iOS app within the Codespace.
